## ℹ️ Notes

- **Implementation Source**: Tools are defined in `apps/agent/src/tools-definition.js` and implemented in `apps/agent/src/executors/`.
- **MCP Fallback**: If a tool is not found in `ToolExecutor` ( `apps/agent/src/tool-executor.js`), the agent attempts to call it via the MCP Manager. `googleSearch` utilizes this.
- **Security**: All System tools run with high privileges. Destructive actions rely on the Supervisor service for recovery.
